# 🔧 Selenium Web Scraper Template

This project is a reusable Python Selenium scraper that can be customized to automate and extract data from **any website**. It includes a working example that scrapes search results from Google and saves them to a CSV file that can be opened with Excel.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Launches a Chrome browser
- Opens [Google.com](https://www.google.com)
- Searches for the term **"Selenium Python"**
- Extracts the text of result titles (`<h3>` elements)
- Saves those titles to a CSV file (`search_results.csv`)

---

## ✅ Example Use Cases

- Price scraping
- Search automation
- Product data extraction
- Form testing
- Job board scraping
- Warranty status checks (with modification)

## ✏️ Customize for Any Site

To adapt the scraper:

- Change the target `url`
- Update the `By.XPATH`, `By.ID`, or `By.NAME` selectors
- Replace search logic or form handling as needed
- Adjust CSV output columns

---

## 🧠 Tips

- Use your browser's **Inspect Tool** to find the right element selectors
- If a website blocks bots, consider using `user-agent` headers or `undetected_chromedriver`
- Always check a site’s **terms of service** before scraping
